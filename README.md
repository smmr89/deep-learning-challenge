# deep-learning-challenge

This repository contains solutions to the Deep learning challenge of Module 21 Neural Networks and Deep Learning. The objective was to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful for a nonprofit funding to the foundation Alphabet Soup. 

## Instructions

* The repository contains `.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook files for an initial model, and also three optimisation models.
